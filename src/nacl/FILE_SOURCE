The ed25519 and sha256/512 implementations are from the NaCl cryptography library.

The NaCl library was placed in the public domain by its authors.

The NaCl build process uses algorithm specific header files with some filename collisions.

Colliding header files are placed in src/$algorithm/include.

These files are not provided in the library distribution and are produced when building the library. 

The versions generated for building the reference implementation of each algorithm are included.

The c source files are placed unchanged in src/$algorithm/src.

The integer definition headers were modified to use stdint.h instead of long long for 64 bit integers.
