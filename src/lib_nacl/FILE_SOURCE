The sha256/512 implementations are from the NaCl (20110221) cryptography library.

The NaCl library was placed in the public domain by its authors.

The ed25519 implementation is from the SUPERCOP (20200618) cryptography library.  

The implementation was also placed in the public domain by its authors.

The build processes for the two libraries use algorithm specific header files with some filename collisions.

Colliding header files are placed in src/$algorithm/include.

These files are not provided in the library distribution and are produced when building the library. 

The versions generated for building the reference implementation of each algorithm are included.

The c source files are placed unchanged in src/$algorithm/src.

The integer definition headers were modified to use stdint.h instead of long long for 64 bit integers.
